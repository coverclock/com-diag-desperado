ABSTRACT

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Desperado package.
Desperado is an open source library of object-oriented software components
written in C++. It implements design patterns that the author has found to be
both useful and common in embedded applications. The most useful portions
of Desperado have been forked into another project called Desperadito with a
much simpler build framework. Desperadito also includes a partial fork of the
Hayloft project. All that Desperadito lacks is the Java and FORTH related
interface classes from Desperado. It is likely that that is the project you
really want to use. Never the less, portions of Desperado (mostly prior to the
Desperadito fork) have legitimately found their way into the commercial products
of some of the Corporation's clients, so don't be surprised if you see this
code elsewhere in your travels.

Desperado is licensed under a modified GNU Lesser General Public License to
allow it to be incorporated into proprietary software or firmware without
restriction or viral licensing implication.

Desperado requires

o   ANSI C++ and ANSI C99-compilant compilers,
o   a POSIX-compliant operating system and run-time library, including
o   POSIX threads, and
o   support for 64-bit integral types.
